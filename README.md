## Process

Before beginning on any design work, I needed to understand the game at basic level. So, I read through the guide on Bicycle and then created a workflow to help me understand it at a high level. Though it wasn't completely necessary for styling, knowledge of the game would guide my designed decisions.

### Steps

1. Designed user flow to understand varies plays and outcomes.
2. Create wireframes of different layout options.
3. Design mockups based on chosen wireframe.
4. Build with HTML/SCSS

## Design Decisions

Originally, I thought it would be fun to really "theme out" the game using a dark color scheme. But, after my research and designing a few mockup options, I opted for a more clean, well-structure styling that was intuitive, informative, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing.

## The Build

For this exercise and for simplicity-sake, I built the mockup with HTML/SCSS for desktop screens only. I leveraged the clamp feature with rem values in CSS to make the UI fluid responsive instead of adding breakpoints.

### Notes

- This is non-functional; just a proof-of-concept.
- The left UI has hover states applied to buttons.
- No clickable features.

## What I Learned

- Breaking up this UI into separate components within a framework is the optimal build approach for scalability and functionality.
- Adding a dark mode would be a nice feature.
- Adding interactions would delight users.
- With more time, a mobile version could be explored.
